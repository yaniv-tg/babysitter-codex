Invoke the babysitter:babysit skill (using the Skill tool) and follow its instructions (SKILL.md).

create and run a retrospect process:

implementations notes (for the process):
- The process should analyze the run, the process that was followed, and provide suggestions for improvements, optimizations, and fixes.
- The process should such have many breakpoints where the user can steer the process, provide feedback, and make decisions about how to proceed with the retrospect.
- The process should be designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of runs, projects, and goals, and should be able to provide insights and suggestions that are relevant and actionable for the user. (modification to the process, skills, etc.)
- The process should be designed to be iterative, allowing the user to go through multiple rounds of analysis and improvement, and should be able to track the changes and improvements made over time.
- The process should cover:
    - Analysis of the run and its results, including what went well, what didn't go well, and what could be improved.
    - Analysis of the process that was followed, including what steps were taken, what tools were used, and how effective they were.
    - Suggestions for improvements, optimizations, and fixes for both the run and the process.
    - Implementing the improvements, optimizations, and fixes, and tracking the changes made over time.
    - Ending by asking the user to run /contrib if the improvement is in the process library (processes, skills, subagents, etc.) or in the babysitter codebase (core or plugins) which will guide them through the contribution process (forking the repo, making the changes, submitting a PR, etc.)
