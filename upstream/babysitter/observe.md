Run the babysitter observer dashboard:

1. Determine the watch directory — this is usually the project's container directory (the parent of the project dir), or the current working directory if not specified.
2. Launch the dashboard: `npx -y @yoavmayer/babysitter-observer-dashboard@latest --watch-dir <dir>`
3. This is a blocking process — it will keep running until stopped.
4. Open the browser at the URL printed by the dashboard.
