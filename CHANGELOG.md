- New hook lifecycle types: `on-tool-error`, `on-policy-block`, `on-retry`.
- Roadmap doc and feature-request issue template.
- Feature-complete implementation pass for requested items 1-10:
  - selector-based session UX (`list`, `search`, alias/tag management)
  - event stream IDs/sequence and configurable notification sinks (including file sink)
  - policy config with staged approvals + strict allowlists
  - persisted model routing policy (`.a5c/config/model-policy.json`)

  - GitHub issue flow with comments, apply mode, and optional PR update/create paths
  - telemetry history and explicit budget phase states (`normal`/`soft-limit`/`hard-stop`)
  - docs: `docs/FEATURES_1_10.md`

### Changed
- Fixed plugin command metadata regression: per-command descriptions restored in `.codex/plugin.json`.
- Command surface increased to 15 modes with `team-install`.
- Updated plugin manifest command set to 15 commands (including `retrospect` and `team-install`) and version `4.0.148`.
- Updated docs/tests for 15-mode parity and upstream-library mapping.
- `orchestrate.js` now emits structured events, supports policy/model/telemetry integration, and records session metadata for resume UX.
- `on-turn-complete` now emits event-stream notifications.
- Dispatcher now executes concrete mode handlers for `model`, `issue`, `resume` selectors, and `doctor mcp`.
- Orchestrator now supports multi-repo alias workdirs and adaptive prompt shrinking under budget pressure.
- Added upstream sync/parity tooling and documentation (`sync:upstream`, `check:upstream`).
- Added explicit compatibility policy checks (`check:compat`) and CI enforcement.
- Added maintainer runbook and real-world validation docs.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- First-class macOS support documentation and install verification steps.
- Cross-platform long-session scenario runner: `test/full-session-long-run.js`.
- GitHub Actions CI matrix for `macos-13`, `ubuntu-latest`, and `windows-2022` on Node `20` and `22`.
- Shared SDK package resolver (`.codex/sdk-package.js`) used by runtime/test entrypoints.

### Changed
- Runtime hooks now resolve SDK package via `BABYSITTER_SDK_PACKAGE`/`BABYSITTER_SDK_VERSION` with consistent wrapper invocation.
- `postinstall` now enforces executable bits (`+x`) for hook shell scripts on non-Windows systems.
- `npm run test:long-scenario` now uses the cross-platform Node runner.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- SDK capability detection with explicit compatibility reporting (`full`, `compat-core`, `unsupported`).
- Deterministic per-run trace logging at `<runDir>/run-trace.jsonl`.
- Trace events across run lifecycle (run/iteration/task requested, executed, posted, failed, completed).
- Windows and Linux installation guides with platform-specific commands.
- Full long-session scenario runner (`test/full-session-long-run.ps1`) that enforces:
  - at least 3 interview breakpoints
  - at least 1 breakpoint with 4 questions
  - user-choice application checks in generated artifact
  - simulated 60-minute workload
  - strict `score == 100` pass gate
- Full scenario runbook and helper scripts:
  - `test/FULL_SESSION_SCENARIO.md`
  - `test/full-session-scenario.js`
  - npm scripts: `test:scenario`, `test:long-scenario`

### Changed
- Orchestrator startup now fails fast when required core SDK commands are missing.
- Health diagnostics now include compatibility-aware missing core/advanced command reporting.
- README now clarifies Babysitter is external to Codex and explains real activation prompts per mode.
- Requirements documentation now clarifies SDK dependency is installed by `babysitter-codex` (non-circular install guidance).
